<tr>
<td><p>1 . Movement of various types can be taken as an indication of life.</p> </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p>2 . The maintenance of life requires processes like nutrition, respiration, transport of materials within the body and excretion of waste products.</p>  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p>3 . Autotrophic nutrition involves the intake of simple inorganic materials from the environment and using an external energy source like the Sun to synthesise complex high-energy organic material.</p>  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p>4 . Heterotrophic nutrition involves the intake of complex material prepared by other organisms.</p> </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p>5 . Holozoic nutrition is a method of nutrition that involves the ingestion of liquid or solid organic material, digestion, absorption and assimilation of it to utilize it. It includes taking in the complex substances and converting them into simpler forms.</p> </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p>6 . In human beings, the food eaten is broken down by various steps along the alimentary canal and the digested food is absorbed in the small intestine to be sent to all cells in the body.</p>  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p>7 . Saprotrophic nutrition or lysotrophic nutrition is a process of chemoheterotrophic extracellular digestion involved in the processing of decayed organic matter. It occurs in saprotrophs, and is most often associated with fungi and soil bacteria.</p> </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p>8 . Parasitic nutrition is a type of nutrition in which the organisms live on or inside the body of their host and derive their food from them.</p> </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p>9 . There are two types of parasites:</p> </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p> i.<b> Ectoparasites:</b> The live outside the body of the host. Example- Mosquito</p> </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p>ii.<b> Endoparasites:</b> They live inside the body of the host. Example- Ascaris</p> </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p>10. During the process of respiration, complex organic compounds such as glucose are broken down to provide energy in the form of ATP. ATP is used to provide energy for other reactions in the cell.</p>  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p>11. Respiration may be aerobic or anaerobic. Aerobic respiration makes more energy available to the organism.</p>  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p>12. Aerobic respiration is the process of producing cellular energy involving oxygen. Cells break down food in the mitochondria in a long, multistep process that produces roughly 36 ATP. The first step in is glycolysis, the second is the citric acid cycle and the third is the electron transport system.</p> </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p>13. Anaerobic respiration is respiration using electron acceptors other than molecular oxygen. Although oxygen is not the final electron acceptor, the process still uses a respiratory electron transport chain .</p> </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p>14. In human beings, the transport of materials such as oxygen, carbon dioxide, food and excretory products is a function of the circulatory system. The circulatory system consists of the heart, blood and blood vessels.</p> </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p>15. In highly differentiated plants, transport of water, minerals, food and other materials is a function of the vascular tissue which consists of xylem and phloem.</p>  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p>16. In human beings, excretory products in the form of soluble nitrogen compounds are removed by the nephrons in the kidneys.</p>  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p>17. Plants use a variety of techniques to get rid of waste material. For example, waste material may be stored in the cell-vacuoles or as gum and resin, removed in the falling leaves, or excreted into the surrounding soil.</p>  </td>
